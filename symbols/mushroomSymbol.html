        <h1> The Caterpillar Mushroom Symbol </h1>
        <h6>The Caterpillar Mushroom represents the difficulties in going through puberty, by having to gain control over her everchanging size. It also could represent the threat of growing sexuality. Alice calls attention to the caterpillar that is destined to change into a butterfly, because caterpillars reach sexual maturity once they hit butterfly form.</h6>
